# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository includes a Script that attempts to tackle the survival prediction problem posed by Kaggle's famous initial competition.
The data is provided by Kaggle during the competition.
It's a classification problem with two possible outcomes, the aim is to build a machine learning model to accurately predict wich passenger will survive and wich won't.

The intention is to show briefly how I conduct a data analysis project. The script is divided in key steps:
- Loading the data
- Analysis of categorical variables
- Analysis of numerical variables
- Outliers treatment
- Null values treatment
- Feature Engineering
- Modelization Phase

At the end of the script I save the results obtained in two csv files (each one for the two best predictive models) that go inside the "results" directory.
